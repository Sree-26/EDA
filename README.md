# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diabetes Dataset

## 📌 Task Overview  
This project is part of a virtual internship program at TechnoHacks Edutech. The objective of the task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a cleaned dataset using Python and common data visualization libraries.

## 🩺 Dataset: Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset  
The dataset contains diagnostic measurements for female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The goal is to analyze patterns that may indicate the presence of diabetes.

### Features:
- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- BloodPressure  
- SkinThickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction  
- Age  
- Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

---

## 🎯 Objective  
- Load and understand the dataset structure  
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis  
- Visualize feature distributions and relationships  
- Identify key factors influencing diabetes outcomes

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading and Inspection  
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas  
- Checked for null values, data types, and descriptive statistics

### 2. Univariate Analysis  
- Visualized distributions using histograms  
- Detected outliers using box plots

### 3. Bivariate Analysis  
- Used count plots to compare outcomes across features  
- Generated pair plots for relational understanding

### 4. Correlation Analysis  
- Computed correlation matrix  
- Created heatmap to visualize feature interdependencies

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Higher glucose and BMI levels are common among diabetic individuals  
- Age and number of pregnancies also show noticeable patterns  
- Certain features like insulin show high variability and potential outliers  
- Correlation heatmap highlighted strong relations useful for modeling
